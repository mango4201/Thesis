\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis is a self-contained primer on robust spanning trees under cost uncertainty.
We formalize and contrast the \emph{Min-Max} and \emph{Min-Max Regret} objectives for
discrete scenario sets and interval uncertainty, prove the foundational tools used later
(fundamental cut/cycle, MST optimality via cut/cycle criteria), and present a curated
synthesis of reported complexity and approximability results. A running micro-graph and
a compact TikZ gallery illustrate how robust solutions differ from nominal MSTs.
